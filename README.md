# Code for the manuscript on how MHC class II genotype does not contribute towards the chemical encoding of heterozygosity and relatedness in a wild vertebrate

___

## Overview

Despite ongoing research, little is known about how an individual's genotype is encoded in odour. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is often focused due to
its importance for survival and its involvement in mate choice. With our analysis we try to shed light on the importance of MHC on chemicals in skin swabs of 
Antarctic fur seals (*Arctozephalus gazella*) compared to the rest of the genomic background. We combinded chemical data with full length MHC DQB II exon 2 sequences 
and data from 41 genome wide distributed microsatellites. In this repository, we provide all the code used for this analysis in two forms. A pre-executed version 
`Code_manuscript.pdf` plus the executable markdown `Code_manuscript.Rmd`.
